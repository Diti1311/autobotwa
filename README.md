## Vercel v0 Usage Summary
I used **Vercel v0** to generate all UI sections including the Navigation bar, Hero section, Features grid, Testimonials, Pricing, and Footer.  
Each component was generated using structured prompts, exported, and integrated into the Next.js project without manual redesign.  
v0 ensured consistent styling, Tailwind classes, responsiveness, and clean JSX output.
